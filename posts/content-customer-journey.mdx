Leads and customers visit a company website for different requirements at various touchpoints of their customer journey. In some instances, the site visit is to browse and research vis-à-vis competitors. Some others browse to gather more information or specifications about the product or process. Certain site visits confirm if the brand has authority and depth of knowledge. Whatever stage the customer is at in their journey, meaningful content helps nudge them further towards your business.

In content creation, the content must be developed for different points of the customer journey. The main stages in a customer’s journey are awareness, consideration and decision. Happy customers eventually become loyal customers and then advocate the brand to others. For the purpose of this article we will look at awareness, consideration and decision stages of the customer journey.

These stages do not follow a linear process. It is a back-and-forth process in which leads and customers go through this process at different times for different products.

### Content for the Awareness Stage

In awareness stage, customers are learning more about the solutions for their specific needs. A good understanding of their needs drives the search for what can satisfy them. Sometimes, they come upon similar products or product alternatives. They may seek information through various resources like websites, social media and friends/family. There must be information for customers in the awareness stage to read or watch and learn from.

Sheeba is looking for a B.tech program in Biotechnology for her daughter. She starts not by shortlisting colleges but by educating herself about the program. She searches on Google for B.E or B.tech in Biotechnology and she finds a lot of material. A college that is keen to get her attention would do well to have content regarding the field of biotechnology, the genesis and growth of biotechnology, its applications and careers in biotechnology. The college can publish reports, whitepapers or share faculty articles about the scope of biotechnology.

Here they are not talking directly about their program but they are increasing awareness and educating the consumer. In doing so they are partners in Sheeba’s research effort and build brand authority.

Let’s look at another instance. Manish is looking to purchase an apartment in Bangalore. A builder website can provide information about the apartment market in Bangalore, the facilities available in different areas, and their pros and cons. They can also share industry reports about the real estate market in Bangalore so that Manish is aware and informed. In building and publishing such content, the builder is establishing itself as a reliable source of information to the user.

### Content and the Consideration Stage

Customers who finish educating themselves about their needs and the market, move on to shortlisting options for their needs. This is called the consideration stage. Here customers are looking for more details on the product or service. They are researching the product and drawing up a shortlist.

In this stage, Sheeba looks at college ranking, faculty credentials, facilities, and other details more closely. She will do this for several biotechnology colleges before she decides to shortlist a few based on her criteria. She does not want to send her daughter to school with fees exceeding her budget and wants flight connectivity to the college destination.

Colleges that share online campus tours, interviews with faculty and placement officers are more likely to make it to her shortlist. A report with the previous year's placements and average salary may also nudge her to put the college on the shortlist. The right content can help put the college in the consideration pile.

### Content and the Decision Stage

In the decision stage, consumers are more likely to go through the details with a fine-toothed comb. They will read the fine print and further prioritize their criteria. They will relook at all their choices and make a final pick.

The builder who wants to sell to Manish could request him to come for a site visit and consultation. He could also share any special offers through mail or use the chatbot to answer all of Manish’s queries about buying an apartment in their portfolio.

Customer testimonials can also play an important role in this stage. Any awards or credentials won by the property could reinforce the property’s design and engineering excellence.
