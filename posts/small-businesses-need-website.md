Statistics for small businesses in 2022 report that they can expect 21% of global sales from online purchases. 85% of consumers  use the Internet to find local businesses. Small businesses without a website could lose [70-80% of prospective customers](pixolabo.com). 76% consumers visit a company website before they visit its physical business. 

Prospective customers research products and services of various companies by reading information available on their websites. They also compare prices and features on the short-listed websites. Based on their research, they form a brand opinion, assess brand credibility, and understand its offerings.
